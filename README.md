Hey, I’m Skyvb

 B.Tech CSE (2nd Year) | IoT & Embedded Systems Learner | C++ / ESP32 / Arduino
 
I like building lightweight tools, experimenting with IoT systems, and creating projects that feel simple, fast, and useful.
Right now I’m deep into embedded development, system design, and improving my C++ fundamentals by building real projects that solve actual problems.

>>What I’m Working On?

Skyvb’s IDE (My CLI-Based Text Editor)
A minimal C++ command-line editor with:
 ✔ Undo/Redo using stacks
 ✔ File operations (save/load/rename/delete)
 ✔ Multi-line edit mode
 ✔ Color-coded terminal output
 ✔ Modular C++ architecture
 ✔ Build and Run commands
 ✔ Designed for future Arduino/ESP32 support
 
Goal: Turn it into a full IoT-focused CLI environment for ESP32 + sensors.

>>Tech Stack & Interests

→ Languages  :
 C++, C, Python, Arduino C, 
 
→ Hardware / IoT :
 ESP32 • Arduino • Sensors (MQ, DHT, etc.) • Wokwi • Tinkercad • BASIC IoT protocols
 
🛠 Skills:
 Data Structures • Embedded Programming • CLI Tools • File Ops • Basic ML for IoT

>>My Current Learning Roadmap
>>
Advanced C++ (modularization, OOP, templates)
ESP32 WiFi + Cloud integration
IoT security & standards
CLI tooling (build tools, script automation)
Sensor data + tiny ML (for microcontrollers)


>> Highlight Projects
→Skyvb’s IDE
A fully homemade C++ text editor — feature-rich, fast, minimal, and evolving.
→ESP32 + Sensor Projects
Gas detection, smart environment logger, cloud logging, etc.
→ ML Regression on IoT Data
Predicting sensor behavior & calibration for MQ sensors.

→ Fun Fact
I prefer building my own tools instead of searching for existing ones.
 Sometimes it’s harder — but I learn way more in the process. 😄
